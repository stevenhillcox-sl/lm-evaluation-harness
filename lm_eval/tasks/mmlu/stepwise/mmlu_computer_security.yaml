"description": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about computer security.\n\n### Instruction:\nSHA-1 has a message digest of\n(A) 160 bits (B) 512 bits (C) 628 bits (D) 820 bits\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>Since SHA-1 is a hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value, its message digest is 160 bits.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>A<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\n_____________ can modify data on your system – so that your system doesn’t run correctly or you can no longer access specific data, or it may even ask for ransom in order to give your access.\n(A) IM – Trojans (B) Backdoor Trojans (C) Trojan-Downloader (D) Ransom Trojan\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>The system is asking for trojans, which are for ransom, which means ransom trojan.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>D<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat is ethical hacking?\n(A) \"Hacking\" ethics so they justify unintended selfish behavior (B) Hacking systems (e.g., during penetration testing) to expose vulnerabilities so they can be fixed, rather than exploited (C) Hacking into systems run by those whose ethics you disagree with (D) A slang term for rapid software development, e.g., as part of hackathons\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>Ethical hacking is a process of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or organization's infrastructure that an attacker can use to exploit an individual or organization. They use this process to prevent cyberattacks and security breaches by lawfully hacking into the systems and looking for weak points.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>B<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nThe ____________ is anything which your search engine cannot search.\n(A) Haunted web (B) World Wide Web (C) Surface web (D) Deep Web\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>The search engine searches on the Surface Web, which is the portion of the world wide web which is visible so (B,C) are wrong. The Haunted Web doesn’t correspond to an internet concept. The Deep Web is the part of the World Wide Web which is not indexed.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>D<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nExploitation of the Heartbleed bug permits\n(A) overwriting cryptographic keys in memory (B) a kind of code injection (C) a read outside bounds of a buffer (D) a format string attack\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. Heartbleed resulted from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension. The vulnerability was classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>C<|answer_end|><|step_end|>"
