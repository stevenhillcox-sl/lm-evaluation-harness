"description": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about formal logic.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhich of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?\nTurtles live long lives and are happy creatures, unless they are injured.\n(A) (L • H) ≡ I (B) (L • H) ∨ I (C) L • (H ∨ I) (D) L • (H ⊃ R).\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help.<|step_end|><|step_start|>Let’s solve this step by step. Let “L” denote “living long”, H “being happy”, and “I” “being injured”. Now, consider each choice:\n(A) means (living long AND being happy) is equivalent to (being injured). \n(B) means (living long AND being happy) OR (being injured). \n(C) means (living long) AND (being happy OR being injured). \n(D) means (living long) AND (being happy implies being R), but what R denotes is not clear.\nObviously, (B) is the best symbolization of the original sentence.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>B<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nSelect the best translation into predicate logic.George borrows Hector's lawnmower. (g: George; h: Hector; l: Hector's lawnmower; Bxyx: x borrows y from z).\n(A) Blgh (B) Bhlg (C) Bglh (D) Bghl\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help.<|step_end|><|step_start|>Let’s solve this step by step. We are told that “Bxyx” means “x borrows y from z”. We can rewrite “George borrows Hector's lawnmower” as “George borrows a lawnmower from Hector”, which can then be translated into predicate logic as “Bglh”. The answer “Bglh” appears in (C); therefore, (C) must be the correct answer.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>C<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\n\nSelect the best English interpretation of the given arguments in predicate logic.\nDm\n(∀x)(Wx ⊃ ~Dx). \n(∀x)Wx ∨ Ag\t/ (∃x)Ax\n(A) Marina is a dancer. Some weaklings are not dancers. Either everything is a weakling or Georgia plays volleyball. So something plays volleyball. (B) Marina is a dancer. No weakling is a dancer. Everything is either a weakling or plays volleyball. So something plays volleyball. (C) Marina is a dancer. Some weaklings are not dancers. Everything is either a weakling or plays volleyball. So something plays volleyball. (D) Marina is a dancer. No weakling is a dancer. Either everything is a weakling or Georgia plays volleyball. So something plays volleyball.\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help.<|step_end|><|step_start|>Let’s solve this step by step. Let “D” denote “being a dancer”, “m” denote “Maria”, “g” denote “Georgia”, “W” denote “weakling”, “A” denote “playing volleyball”. Then, we have the following:\n1. Dm → Maria is a dance.\n2. (∀x)(Wx ⊃ ~Dx). → For all x, if x is a weakling, then x is not a dancer. In other words, no weakling is a dancer.\n3. (∀x)Wx ∨ Ag\t/ (∃x)Ax → For all x, x is a weakling or Georgia plays volleyball. So there exists an x that plays volleyball. \nOptions (A) and (C) do claim that some weaklings are not dancers, but the second argument strongly states that no weakling is a dancer. Thus, we can eliminate them. Option (B) omits the important detail about Georgia playing volleyball. Option (D) has all the details presented in the arguments and is the best English interpretation of the arguments.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>D<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nSelect the best translation into predicate logic: No people drive on Mars.\n(A) ~Pd (B) (∀x)(Px ∨ ~Dx) (C) (∀x)(Px ⊃ ~Dx) (D) ~Dp\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help.<|step_end|><|step_start|>Let’s solve this step by step. Let “P” denote “being on Mars” and “D” denote “driving on Mars”. Then let’s consider each option:\nOption (A): ~Pd → d is not on Mars.\nOption (B): (∀x)(Px ∨ ~Dx) → For all x, x is on Mars and x do not drive on Mars.\nOption (C): (∀x)(Px ⊃ ~Dx) → For all x, x is on Mars implies that x do not drive on Mars.\nOption (D): ~Dp: → p do not drive on Mars.\nOf all these options, Option (C) appears to be the best and most meaningful interpretation of the argument “No people drive on Mars.”<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>C<|answer_end|><|step_end|>"
