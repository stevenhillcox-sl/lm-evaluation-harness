"description": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school biology.\n\n### Instruction:\nIn animal cells, which of the following represents the most likely pathway that a secretory protein takes as it is synthesized in a cell?\n(A) Plasma membrane–Golgi apparatus–ribosome–secretory vesicle–rough ER (B) Ribosome–Golgi apparatus–rough ER–secretory vesicle–plasma membrane (C) Plasma membrane–Golgi apparatus–ribosome–secretory vesicle–rough ER (D) Ribosome–rough ER–Golgi apparatus–secretory vesicle–plasma membrane\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>Protein synthesis starts at the ribosome, so we can eliminate (A) and (C). The ribosome is often in the endoplasmic reticulum and moves from there to the Golgi apparatus, where it is modified and packaged into a vesicle. The vesicle then floats to the plasma membrane and is secreted.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>D<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nA mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme’s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity?\n(A) By changing the enzyme’s pH optimum (B) By changing the enzyme’s location in the cell (C) By changing the shape of the protein (D) An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity.\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>A change in an amino acid leads to a change in the primary structure of the protein. A change in the primary structure may lead to a change in the secondary and the tertiary structure of the protein. A change in the tertiary structure means a change in the shape of the protein, so (C) has to be correct. Since the change does not affect the active site of the enzyme, we do not expect the activity of the enzyme to be affected.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>C<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nWhich of the following is not a way to form recombinant DNA?\n(A) Translation (B) Conjugation (C) Specialized transduction (D) Transformation\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>The introduction of foreign DNA or RNA into bacteria or eukaryotic cells is a common technique in molecular biology and scientific research. There are multiple ways foreign DNA can be introduced into cells including transformation, transduction, conjugation, and transfection. In contrast, (A) is not a way to form DNA: during translation the ribosomes synthesize proteins from RNA.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>A<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nHomologous structures are often cited as evidence for the process of natural selection. All of the following are examples of homologous structures EXCEPT\n(A) the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat (B) the flippers of a whale and the arms of a man (C) the pectoral fins of a porpoise and the flippers of a seal (D) the forelegs of an insect and the forelimbs of a dog\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>​​Homologous structures are similar physical features in organisms that share a common ancestor ​​but different functions. Comparisons (B) and (C) are clearly homologous because they share a common ancestor and the structures serve different purposes. Bat wings and birg wings are also homologous, while they are both wings, the forelimbs serve different purposes. Insects and dogs are very far ancestors since one is vertebrate while the other is invertebrate and the forelimbs serve the same purpose, so they are not homologous.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>D<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nWhich of the following is not known to be involved in the control of cell division?\n(A) Cyclins (B) Protein kinases (C) Checkpoints (D) Fibroblast cells\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>Normal cells move through the cell cycle in a regulated way. At the checkpoint stage, they use information about their own internal state and cues from the environment around them to decide whether to proceed with cell division. Cues like these act by changing the activity of core cell cycle regulators inside the cell. The most common regulators are cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. Fibroblast cells do not play any role in cell division.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>D<|answer_end|><|step_end|>"
