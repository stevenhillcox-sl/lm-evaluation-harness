"description": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about elementary mathematics.\n\n### Instruction:\nOlivia used the rule \"Add 11\" to create the number pattern shown below. 10, 21, 32, 43, 54. Which statement about the number pattern is true?\n(A) The 10th number in the pattern will be an even number.\n(B) The number pattern will never have two even numbers next to each other.\n(C) The next two numbers in the pattern will be an even number then an odd number.\n(D) If the number pattern started with an odd number then the pattern would have only odd numbers in it.\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>Choice A is incorrect because every even-numbered term in the pattern is odd, and 10 is an even number. Choice B is correct, because adding an odd number (in this case 11) to an odd number produces an even number, and adding an odd number to an even number produces an odd number. Thus the terms in the pattern will alternate between odd and even, so there will never be two even numbers next to each other. Choice C is incorrect because the last term in the example is even (54), and we know that the terms will alternate between even and odd. Choice D is incorrect because the terms in the pattern will alternate between odd and even, regardless of the value of the first term.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>B<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nThe population of the city where Michelle was born is 145,826. What is the value of the 5 in the number 145,826?\n(A) 5 thousands\n(B) 5 hundreds\n(C) 5 tens\n(D) 5 ones\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>Choice A is correct, because there are three digits following the 5, so\nthe 5 is in the thousands place. Thus the other choices are incorrect.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>A<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nA store sells 107 different colors of paint. They have 25 cans of each color in storage. The number of cans of paint the store has in storage can be found using the expression below. 107 Ã— 25. How many cans of paint does the store have in storage?\n(A) 749\n(B) 2,675\n(C) 2,945\n(D) 4,250\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We can calculate 107 x 25 = (100 x 25) + (7 x 25) = 2500 + 175 = 2675.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>B<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nA total of 30 players will play basketball at a park. There will be exactly 5 players on each team. Which statement correctly explains how to find the number of teams needed?\n(A) Add 5 to 30 to find 35 teams.\n(B) Divide 30 by 5 to find 6 teams.\n(C) Multiply 30 and 5 to find 150 teams.\n(D) Subtract 5 from 30 to find 25 teams.\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We want to find the number of teams.<|step_end|><|step_start|>We know that there are 5 players/team, and 30 players.<|step_end|><|step_start|>Thus to get the number of teams we divide players by players/team, so 30 players / 5 players/team = 6 teams.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>B<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nWhich expression is equivalent to 5 x 9?\n(A) (5 x 4) x (6 x 5)\n(B) (5 x 5) + (5 x 4)\n(C) (5 x 5) + (5 x 9)\n(D) (5 x 9) x (6 x 9)\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We know that 9 = (5 + 4), so 5 x 9 = 5 x (5 + 4) = (5 x 5) + (5 x 4).<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>B<|answer_end|><|step_end|>"
