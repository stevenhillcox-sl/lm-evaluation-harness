"description": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about astronomy.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\n(A) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt. (B) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt. (C) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. (D) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>A<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nYou are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton’s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn’t matter that it’s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>D<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>A<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nWhy isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it’s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>D<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nWhy is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A).<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>A<|answer_end|><|step_end|>"
