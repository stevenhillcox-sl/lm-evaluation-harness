"description": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about logical fallacies.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhen an arguer causes confusion during refutation because of real or feigned lack of an ability to engage in refutation, that arguer may have committed the fallacy of\n(A) poor sportsmanship (B) appeal to compassion (C) argument against the person (D) ignorance of refutation\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We refer to Wikipedia articles on logical fallacies for help.<|step_end|><|step_start|>Ignorance of refutation, one of Aristotle's original list of logical fallacies in his Organon, is when someone causes confusion in an argument through real or feigned inability to engage in refutation, in order to win the argument.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>D<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nThe complex question fallacy consists of\n(A) arguing something is inferior just because it doesn't do something it was never intended to do. (B) including more than one claim in the proposition and treating proof for one claim as proof for all the claims. (C) drawing a conclusion before examining the evidence, and only considering evidence that supports that conclusion. (D) asking a question that includes either an unproven assumption or more than one question, thus making a straightforward yes or no answer meaningless.\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We refer to Wikipedia articles on logical fallacies for help.<|step_end|><|step_start|>The complex question fallacy is when someone makes a single yes or no answer to a question meaningless, by including either an unproven assumption or many questions. The latter is also known as the many questions fallacy.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>D<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nArguing that what is true of the parts must be true of the whole is the fallacy of...\n(A) Division (B) Composition (C) Appeal to the person (D) Appeal to ignorance\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We refer to Wikipedia articles on logical fallacies for help.<|step_end|><|step_start|>Fallacy of composition occurs when someone argues what is true of the parts must be true of the whole.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>B<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nWhich of the following is true of a valid categorical syllogism?\n(A) The minor premise must deny the antecedent (B) The major premise must affirm the consequent (C) The middle term must be used in at least one premise in a universal or unqualified sense (D) All of the above\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We refer to Wikipedia articles on logical fallacies for help.<|step_end|><|step_start|>A valid categorical syllogism must satisfy several conditions: (1) the syllogism must have exactly three terms (2) every term of the syllogism must be used twice exactly, (3) a term may be used only once in any premise, and (4) the middle term must be used in at least one premise in a universal or unqualified sense, etc. Only (C) is true.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>C<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nIf someone attacks the character of an opposing arguer, instead of responding to that opponent's arguments, the first person has probably committed which of the following fallacies?\n(A) tu quoque (B) horse laugh (C) argument against the person (D) ignoratio elenchi\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We refer to Wikipedia articles on logical fallacies for help.<|step_end|><|step_start|>The argument against the person fallacy occurs when someone irrelevantly attacks the character of an opposing arguer, instead of addressing that opponent's arguments.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>C<|answer_end|><|step_end|>"
