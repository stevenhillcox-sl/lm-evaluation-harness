"description": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college physics.\n\n### Instruction:\nA refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is\n(A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 20\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>A<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nThe muon decays with a characteristic lifetime of about 10^-6 second into an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron antineutrino. The muon is forbidden from decaying into an electron and just a single neutrino by the law of conservation of\n(A) charge (B) mass (C) energy and momentum (D) lepton number\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>Lepton number must be conserved, meaning the total number of leptons minus the number of antileptons. If a muon decays into an electron and a single neutrino, the total lepton number would go from one to two, violating lepton number conservation.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>D<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nOne end of a Nichrome wire of length 2L and cross-sectional area A is attached to an end of another Nichrome wire of length L and cross- sectional area 2A. If the free end of the longer wire is at an electric potential of 8.0 volts, and the free end of the shorter wire is at an electric potential of 1.0 volt, the potential at the junction of the two wires is most nearly equal to\n(A) 2.4 V (B) 3.3 V (C) 4.5 V (D) 5.7 V\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>This is a simple voltage divider problem, where the longer wire has a resistance four times that of the shorter end. So the voltage divider ratio is 1 / 5, meaning that the potential in the middle is 1.0 V + (8.0 V - 1.0 V) * 1/5 = 2.4 V.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>A<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nA refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm.

However, if the volume of the gas container is constant, no work will be done (since work is pressure times change in volume). So, at constant volume, all of the heat goes into the internal energy.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>B<|answer_end|><|step_end|>"
