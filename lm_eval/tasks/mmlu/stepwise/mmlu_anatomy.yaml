"description": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about anatomy.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhich of the following is the body cavity that contains the pituitary gland?\n(A) Abdominal (B) Cranial (C) Pleural (D) Spinal\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help.<|step_end|><|step_start|>The pituitary gland is the major endocrine gland attached to the base of the brain, and it is contained in the Cranial cavity.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>B<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nWhich of these branches of the trigeminal nerve contain somatic motor processes?\n(A) The supraorbital nerve (B) The infraorbital nerve (C) The mental nerve (D) None of the above\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help.<|step_end|><|step_start|>\nWe know the following: (A) The supraorbital nerve (also known as the frontal nerve) is the largest branch of the ophthalmic nerve and branch of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. (B) The infraorbital nerve is a branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. (C) The mental nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. Because all these nerves are purely sensory nerves and do not contain any somatic motor processes.<|step_end|><|step_start|>Therefore, the answer should be none of the above, which is (D).<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>D<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nIn Angle's Class II Div 2 occlusion there is\n(A) excess overbite of the upper lateral incisors. (B) negative overjet of the upper central incisors. (C) excess overjet of the upper lateral incisors. (D) excess overjet of the upper central incisors.\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help.<|step_end|><|step_start|>This is a question related to anatomy and orthodontics. Excess overjet is associated with Class II occlusions; therefore, we can safely eliminate (B) from the list, as negative overjet is often associated with Class III occlusions. Now, we need to determine the location of the excess overjet, and that would be the upper (maxillary) lateral incisors. Only (C) has the correct information.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>C<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nThe pleura\n(A) have no sensory innervation. (B) are separated by a 2 mm space. (C) extend into the neck. (D) are composed of respiratory epithelium.\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help.<|step_end|><|step_start|>First, recall that the pleura refers to the thin layer of tissue that covers the lungs and lines the interior wall of the chest cavity.<|step_end|><|step_start|>Now, let’s look at each option:\nOption (A): “The pleura have no sensory innervation.” This information is not correct. The pleura do have a sensory innervation.\nOption (B): “The pleura are separated by a 2 mm space.” This information is not correct. There is a very thin “potential” space between the layers of the pleura; however, it is typically filled with serous pleural fluid. \nOption (C): “The pleura extend into the neck.” This information is actuakky true. The cervical pleura, also known as the dome of the pleuradome of the pleura, lines the extendsiton of the pleural cavity into the neck.\nOption (D): “The pleura are composed of respiratory epithelium.” This information is not correct. The pleaura are composed of connective tissue (CT).<|step_end|><|step_start|>Because (A), (B), and (D) are all incorrect, (D) is the only correct answer.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>C<|answer_end|><|step_end|>\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat is the embryological origin of the hyoid bone?\n(A) The first pharyngeal arch (B) The first and second pharyngeal arches (C) The second pharyngeal arch (D) The second and third pharyngeal arches\n\n### Response:\n<|step_start|>We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help.<|step_end|><|step_start|>The hyoid bone, which is also known as the hyooid, is a a small U-shaped bone located in the anterior neck. In its resting position, it lies between the ase of the mandible and the third cervical vertebrae.<|step_end|><|step_start|>We know that the second and the third pharyngeal arches give rise to the horns of the hyoid bone; therefore, the embryological origin of the hyoid bone are the second and the third pharyngeal arches—this information is covered in the last option (D).<|step_end|><|step_start|>Therefore, we conclude that (D) must be the correct answer.<|step_end|><|step_start|><|answer_start|>D<|answer_end|><|step_end|>"
